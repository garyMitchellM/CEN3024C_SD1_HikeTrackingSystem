# CEN3024C_SD1_HikeTrackingSystem
This repository contains Java code for the Module 7 | DMS Project Phase 1: Logic and Input Validation assignment.

The software is a hike tracking system that allows a user to add (either manually or through uploading a .txt file), view, update, and delete hikes in the system. The system also calculates the total distance of all hikes in the system. Hike data includes a name, location, distance, duration, elevation, and difficulty level. The program checks for correctly formatted and valid data before creating a new hike object. The distance cannot be less than or equal to 0, and the elevation cannot be less than 0. Each hike object will be stored in an ArrayList, and the main menu will be handled using a switch statement. The program will continue to run until the user chooses to quit the program.
