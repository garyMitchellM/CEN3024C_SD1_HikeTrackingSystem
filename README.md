# CEN3024C_SD1_HikeTrackingSystem

Gary Montero 3024C - Software Development 1 CRN: 24204

This repository contains Java code for the Module 11 | Software Documentation assignment. The software is a hike tracking system that allows a user to add (either manually or through uploading a .txt file), view, update, and delete hikes in the system. The system also calculates the total distance of all hikes in the system. Hike data includes a name, location, distance, duration, elevation, and difficulty level. The program checks for correctly formatted and valid data before creating a new hike object. The distance cannot be less than or equal to 0, and the elevation cannot be less than 0. Each hike will be stored in a MySQL database, and the main menu will be handled with a graphical user interface using Java Swing. The program will continue to run until the user chooses to exit by closing the program window or selecting the exit button.
